This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection using a webcam. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO series, and it comes with significant improvements in terms of performance and detection quality.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a webcam feed.
- Support for multiple object classes.
- Easy-to-use interface with OpenCV.
- Supervised learning with labeled datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV 4.5+ (with video support)
- supervision 0.3.0
- numpy
- torch >= 1.9.0
- torchvision >= 0.10.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/YOLOv8-object-detection.git](https://github.com/S4vad/YOLOv8_object_detection_in_Real-time_web-cam_with_openCV_and_supervision.git)https://github.com/S4vad/YOLOv8_object_detection_in_Real-time_web-cam_with_openCV_and_supervision.git
